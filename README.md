# IP_BASED_PATIENT_MONITORING_SYSTEM
The â€œIP-Based Patient Monitoring System uses TCP/IP and socket programming to send real-time vital signs like heart rate and temperature from a client to a server. It enables remote healthcare monitoring, ideal for telemedicine, and can be expanded with multi-client support, alerts, and data storage for enhanced care.
